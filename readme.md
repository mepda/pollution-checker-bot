#Slack Pollution Checking Bot!
This is a bot that can be used to check the air quality
of various cities. It runs in slack and currently is
configured to live in #general.

##Configuration
Currently this app can be deployed to heroku or some other
hosting provider, but first you'll need to get some keys.
The first key is for the bot itself, which can be done in
your slack. The second key you'll need is for the aqi api.
Once you have those, add them into your program (source)
under config/app-env (you can change the name, but you'll
have to change the npm run start command also)

##Enjoy and I hope you breathe a little easier with this bot!
